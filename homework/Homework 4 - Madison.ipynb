    "## 1.1 The Term Spread\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What is the term spread?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The term spread is the difference between the long-term and short-term interest rates. It is usually calculated by subtracting the rate of the three month Treasury bill from the ten year Treasury bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What is the preferred measure of the term spread in the case?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The rates used usually come from Treasury securities to minimize issues of credit risk, and as stated earlier is calculated using the three month Treasury bill and the ten year Treasury bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What evidence is cited for the term spread's power in predicting recessions?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical evidence seems to be the main evidence used when determining the term spread's power for predicting recessions, as it seems to show that when the yield curve is positively sloped, economic growth is strong over the next 4-6 quarters. It also shows that when yield curve is inverted, it predicts a recession.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Which is more important, the level of the term spread, its month-over-month change, or the level of short rates?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The month-over-month change of the term spread seems to have the most impact in determining economic growth/recession.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Using the file yields_2022-11-30.xlsx, calculate the term spread as of the end of November 2022. (Measure it with the 10-year and 1-year yields.)</b>"

    "Term premium is some additional value added to the weighted average of short term rates to calculate the long term rate. Conceptually speaking, it is the additional rate added to the ten year bond to offset the risk investors take that interest rates will change over the course of the next ten years. It is impossible to get a direct measure of it because it is only an estimate, not a number written into any contract or able to be directly observed.\n",

For example, if the term premium became smaller, and the yield curve flattened (slope decreased) as a result, then we could expect growth in the economy, not stagnation."
